# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview
This project used BeautifulSoup and Splinter in python to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images. The Mars Facts were summarized using pd.read_html. The scraped data were stored on a Mongo database, and a web application in python (Flask) was used to display the data, and alter the design of the web app using Bootstrap 3 to accommodate these images.

## Softwares:
Pandas, BeautifulSoup, Splinter, ChromeDriverManager, Flask, PyMongo, MongoDB, HTML5, Bootstrap 3

## Results:

The image URLs and titles of Mars's hemispheres were add a dictionary.
